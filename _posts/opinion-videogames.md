You know what drives me a little crazy? The stereotype that comes with playing video games. Growing up I wouldn't stop hearing about how either video games would kill my brain, or I'd live long enough to become ~~the villian~~ the guy who starts a school shooting. People have told me, "There have been studies that prove video games lead to violence." Yeah, I know there are studies out there, but don't let one bad apple ruin the whole tree. Have you ever wondered out of everyone who plays video games, how many of them do something terrible because of a game?

But that's not the worst of it (obviously people dying is pretty bad, i'm not heartless). The worst part about this stereotype is the way they look at you when they find out you play games. When I was in my early pre-teens, I had a teacher who would ask me weekly, "How's Space Destroyer 3000 going?" And everytime I sheepishly said, it's good. I never had the guts to tell him how I ddin't appreciate it. It felt like he was making fun of me, not even trying to connect on my level.

But that was a long time and I don't hold it against him. But those types of comments haven't stopped. Even as an adult I've had people ask me, "oh your a gamer right? So you probably don't have better things to do" (obviously generalized, I like to think that people aren't genuinely this rude).

The result of all these personal attacks? I don't let people I game until I know it's safe. If people ask me what I do for fun, I usually say something publically accepted like hiking, or spending time with my family. And although I do enjoy those things, I spend a lot more time playing games than exploring a mountain range. But I'm scared to tell anyone that! Because I am scared they will judge me and think of me as a lesser person because of how I choose to spend my time. What's the difference between spending my free time playing a game, or watching a movie? I'll tell you, one of those is publically accepted.

Fortunately, we live in an age where video games are pretty much unavoidable. They've invaded our homes through our streaming devices, our phones, and of course our tv. And if you don't play games in your home, how much do you want to bet that of the 5 homes surrounding you, half of them have some sort of regular gameplay going on inside?

So if "everyone does it" why am I still scared to share my passion? I think it's because it's a guilty pleasure. There's another stereotype that is closely associated with video games. It's the guy that lives in his mom's basement. If I were to tell you that I am a single male in my mid thirties and I live with my mother, would you assume I played games? How about if I was a male at all, regardless of my living situation?

I think that there's a pattern here. Women are to social media as men are to video games. The problem I see is that it's ok to be social ans stalk your roomates ex-boyfriend. But it's not ok to play games for a couple hours on Saturday. Maybe I need to grow a pair, but I feel like I can never share with a stranger than I happily play video games on a regular basis.

At least I couldn't before I wrote this article. ;)
